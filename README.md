#Stranger
Stranger is an Android application which a team and I developed at Dukeâ€™s Hackathon, in 24 hours. This App is designed for people of all ages. Also people that are shy could use it with ease and meet someone around them. The matching portion of the application was developed using the Watsons Matching API. This is a combination of Omegle and Chat. This was developed in Java under Eclipse to make the interface, JavaScript for the data storage and communication also for matching user. We used Python to allow the user to connect with Facebook so the program could use their Facebook information.
